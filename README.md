# Docker image downloader

There is 2 scripts for interacting with Docker Hub without needing the Docker client itself.

It interacts with the Docker registry [HTTPS API v2](https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/api/).

## Python version

Examples :

```bash
python pull.py <image-name>:<tag>


python pull.py hello-world
python pull.py prom/prometheus:v2.19.2
python pull.py mcr.microsoft.com/mssql-tools
```

### Limitations

- Only support v2 manifests. Some registries ( like [quay.io](https://quay.io) ) which only uses v1 manifests, may not work.
- Some big images may fail to unzip during the extract process

---

## Bash version

This script has not above limits. But you **can't** run this on windows

```bash
chmod +x pull.sh
./pull.sh <directory_name> <image-name>:<tag>


./pull.sh prometheus prom/prometheus:v2.19.2
./pull.sh mysql-5.7 mysql:5.7
```

## Load image

You can load images using `docker load` as follow :

```bash
docker load -i <file-name>.tar
```
